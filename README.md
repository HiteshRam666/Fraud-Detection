# 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection System

Welcome to the Fraud Detection System! This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent activities.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Fraud_Detection.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing, model building, and detecting fraud.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-system.git
    cd fraud-detection-system
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Fraud_Detection.ipynb
    ```

2. Run all the cells to load the data, preprocess it, and detect fraudulent activities.

## 📊 Data
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection/data

The dataset used in this project typically contains the following columns:
- `transactionID`: Unique identifier for each transaction
- `amount`: The amount of the transaction
- `timestamp`: The time of the transaction
- `fraud`: Binary indicator (0 or 1) of whether the transaction is fraudulent

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Train various machine learning models to detect fraud.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.

## 📈 Results

The system detects fraudulent transactions with high accuracy using machine learning models.
